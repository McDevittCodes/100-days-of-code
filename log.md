# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 15, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on FreeCodeCamp’s JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure certification. Began Basic Javascript section.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to get back into code. The Basic JavaScript problems are review, however I'm sure that will quickly change as I advance through the course.

### Day 2: October 16, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on FreeCodeCamp’s JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure certification. Just over two-thirds done with the Basic Javascript section.

**Thoughts:** Today I reviewed topics such as: arrays, push / pop & shift / unshift, functions, global & local scopes, boolean values, comparison operators, and else / else if statements. I feel confident in completing my review of Basic JavaScript tommorow.

### Day 3: October 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Updated my portfolio site by addding new projects and a footer. Spent some time on JavaScript switch statements.

**Thoughts:** Took a bit of a detour and reworked my portfolio site today, which was much needed. Spent some time on switch statements, which was a new concept for me since I typically would use else if.
