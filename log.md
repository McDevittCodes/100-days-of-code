# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 15, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on FreeCodeCampâ€™s JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure certification. Began Basic Javascript section.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to get back into code. The Basic JavaScript problems are review, however I'm sure that will quickly change as I advance through the course.
